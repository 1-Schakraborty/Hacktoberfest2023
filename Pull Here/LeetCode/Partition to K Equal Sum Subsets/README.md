## What to Do:
 - Go to folder: ".\CP\LeetCode\Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets"
 - Take your GitHUB username id like "hrithik339", "hacker-boy", etc or anything which you have.
## Problem:
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if it is possible to divide this array into k non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

## Constraints
 - 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 16
 - 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 - The frequency of each element is in the range [1, 4].

## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4,3,2,3,5,2,1], k = 4
Output: true
Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.

```
## Example 2:
 ```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
Output: false
```
# Template Function : 

 - ## C++:
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPartitionKSubsets(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
    }
};
```

 - ## Python :
```
class Solution:
    def canPartitionKSubsets(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        
```
