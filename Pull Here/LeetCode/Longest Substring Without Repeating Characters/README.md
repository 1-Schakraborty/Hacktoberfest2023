# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
## Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
## What to Do:
 - Go to folder:   "\CP\LeetCode\Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"
 - Take your GitHUB username id like "hrithik339", "hacker-boy", etc or anything which you have.

## Problem:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Constraints
 - 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
 - s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3

```
## Example 2:
 ```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

## Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## Example 4:
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```
# Template Function : 

- ## C++:
```
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        
    }
};
```
- ## Python:
```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
```
